### Hi there 👋

I'm François, the developer happiness engineer.

I left my job in early 2021 to focus on building developer tools such as [Preview.js](https://previewjs.com).

I'm hoping to build a sustainable income from my open-source work, so I can continue doing what I love and helping improve developers' workflows.
